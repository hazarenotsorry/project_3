<p>During the turkey month, Riot Games hosts the annual professional League of Legends Worlds Tournament. Each year they invite teams from each of the registered League of Legends regions to compete for a chance to win the the Summoner’s Cup. With South Korea taking home the trophy for first place at the League of Legends World Championship this year. </p> 

<p>The teams are usually made of individuals from the same regions in which they’re playing, but that’s not always the case. Historically, North American regional teams have their positions filled by domestic and often international players. This trend has only increased as the League of Legends Worlds Championship took hold and solidified itself as one of and, as of this year, the most viewed Esports game in the history of competitive video games.</p>

<p>Similar to the martial arts featured in fighting games, video games have become the great equalizer for a multitude of communities and demographics. Despite their language and cultural barriers, gamers from all walks of life have been coming together and converging online, and in person, to support each other in the games they enjoy playing or watching.</p>
